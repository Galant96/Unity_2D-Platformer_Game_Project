# THE RULES OF THE GAME

Player has control over the main character in the game. The hero can move, jump and shoot by using specific inputs from the keyboard and mouse. 

Left Arrow, A – move player moves left.
Right Arrow, D – player moves right.
Up Arrow, W – player jumps.
Left Mouse Button – player shoots.

Throughout the gameplay, a user has to deal with enemies and obstacles. The player may use its adroitness to overcome the danger or just use its gun to destroy some of them. The game is lost if the player health is equal 0 or it falls down into a gap between platforms.

To accomplish the level of the game the player must collect some antidote from the current level. However, it may also avoid them until it decides. One of the reasons is that the user would like to score more points for destroying enemies and then collect the required number of antidotes for progressing to the next stage.

# DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

The design concept of the application is inspired by zombie-survival games. Thereby, the atmosphere of the production and gameplay is dark and heavy. It may help players to integrate with the in-game world. What is more, the player is able to control the main character, who is a survivor from the zombie apocalypse and its main objective is to collect antidote and destroy or jump over hordes of zombies.
